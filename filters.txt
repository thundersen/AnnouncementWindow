## Feel free to tweak this file as you wish, each line must follow the format:##
## [group][subgroup] "re_expression"                                          ##
## -> [group] -> tag to define a global color for all matches                 ##
## -> [category] -> tag to toggle visibility in each window.                  ##
## -> re_expression must follow standard regular expression syntax.           ##
##    -> see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html for more information.  ##
##                                                                            ##
## The announcements will be compared in order that the tags are listed.      ##
## The first instance of a tag will check every expression with that tag      ##
## before moving onto the next tag in the file. Entries with the same tags    ##
## will be checked in the order that they appear.                             ##
## The order of the expressions listed in the filters configuration window    ##
## is the same order that they are compared.                                  ##
##                                                                            ##
## For example, adding '[everything][] "(.+)"' to the start of the file will  ##
## match every announcement/report and no other matches will be found.        ##
## Adding the same expression to the end of the file will catch everything    ##
## that slips through the other filters (note: this expression is             ##
## automatically appended to this file, with the tag "UNKNOWN").              ##
##                                                                            ##
